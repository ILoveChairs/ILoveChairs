## 🔧 Current stack
I know a bunch of technologies, but i want to showcase my current favourites.


### 🐸 Dart Frog (Dart)
Even if I learned this framework as a stopgap solution, I ended up loving it.
It's a very developer-friendly Restful API framework for dart,
being able to start a project with `create` and add routes with `add route`.
For more complex problems, it is also very comfortable,
letting you define your middleware, pre-server-run code and post-server-run code.
The documentation is really, really good as well.

### 🍶 Flask (Python)
Flask is, let's say minimalist.
It is a Restful API framework, but it's main characteristic is that it is highly unopinionated.
Other than helping you expose endpoints and running a server,
other features must be imported and implemented.

This makes it a very modular language, where you use only what you need.
It is very good for small applications where you don't need ORMs or auth or
other features and patterns that are forced upon you on other frameworks.
However it may increase the development time as everything haves to be done manually.
