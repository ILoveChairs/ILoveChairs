## ‚ùì _Who am i?_
I'm a backend developer wannabe that likes chairs and carrots.

I've grown up around computers, so eventually once I got into programming it was
obvious to me that I wanted to work in this area.

From Scratch to web design, to Python, JS and C, my learning journey was a bit of a rough one.
However I started young so I was able to develop a lot of the computational thinking early on.

I really like backend, but I also love low-level and other areas.
Even if i'm a litte lazy sometimes I think I can accomplish everything given enough time.

### üè´ Holberton School
I learnt programming through a robotics workshop and other public school extracurricular activities.
However I was not happy with how little I have done in terms of software projects.
So I decided to get serious and go to either uni or something else.

I ended up going to something else.
That something else was Holberton School, which is an on-site "bootcamp" where you learn how to code.
It takes you from low-level programming with C to high-level with Python and JS (and a final project).
It tries to simulate a working environment to help you develop your soft skills which I found
really helpful, as I lacked plenty of social skills that I wanted to work on.

I really loved the experience.
The duration was 9 months for the fundamentals and if I wanted to, I could do another 9 for a specialization.
I decided to go on my own after the fundamentals hoping to quickly get into the job market.

### üïü Now
Now that i'm out of all schools, my idea is to land a job as a Junior Backend.
I know how to solve problems, I know how to make APIs (or so I guess),
and I know many technologies that can be translated across languages.

While I search for a job I am going to be developing showcase applications
and a personal web page that can help me get close to making a living with this.
I would also like to learn more robust languages like Java, C++, C#, Rust and GO.
However I do not want to specialize in so many that I end up overloading my monkey brain.

## üîß Current stack
I know a bunch of technologies, but i want to showcase my current favourites.

### üê∏ Dart Frog (Dart)
Even if I learned this framework as a stopgap solution, I ended up loving it.
It's a very developer-friendly Restful API framework for dart,
being able to start a project with `create` and add routes with `add route`.
For more complex problems, it is also very comfortable,
letting you define your middleware, pre-server-run code and post-server-run code.
The documentation is really, really good as well.

All in all I would really recommend it to new developers.
It is just so easy to create a project and leave it working.
And the fact that you can build your app with a single `build` command and then
freely deploy it in the cloud with Globe with a few clicks is amazing.

### üç∂ Flask (Python)
Flask is, let's say minimalist.
It is a Restful API framework, but it's main characteristic is that it is highly unopinionated.
Other than helping you expose endpoints and running a server,
other features must be imported and implemented.

This makes it a very modular language, where you use only what you need.
It is very good for small applications where you don't need ORMs or auth or
other features and patterns that are forced upon you on other frameworks.
However it may increase the development time as everything haves to be done manually.

Once you get used to it, it can be a very powerful tool,
specially if you're already familiar with python.
